# TV-Script-Generation-with-LSTM
Project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
The starter code was provided by Udacity. The key highlights of the things I implemented is listed below
1) Creation of a lookup table that maps each word in the vocabulary to an integer
2) Defining and coding up the LSTM Architecture and the forward propagation steps
